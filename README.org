* Programs
Install the following programs:
- emacs
- vim
- fish
- sxhkd
- bspwm
- rofi
- polybar
- Luke Smith's fork of st
- dunst

* How to install
Do this in the home directory because the install script (by me, a terrible shell scripter) assumes that you are in the home directory
#+BEGIN_SRC shell
git clone https://github.com/raynei86/dotfile.git
cd dotfiles
./install
#+END_SRC
